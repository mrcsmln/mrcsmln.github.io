# Personal Website

My personal website, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Planned Sections

- **About Me** — Introduction and bio
- **Projects** — Showcase of my work
- **Blog** — Articles and posts
- **Contact** — Ways to get in touch

## Hosting

This site is deployed via GitHub Pages. Once the repo is set up:

1. Push the code to a GitHub repository named `<your-username>.github.io`
2. Go to **Settings → Pages** in the repo
3. Set the source to the `main` branch (or `/docs` folder if preferred)
4. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io`

## Local Development

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or use a simple local server:

```bash
# Python (no install needed on most systems)
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
